README

you're going to need a good server to test with. I've found http://www.seleniumsoftware.com/regform.php?itemdesc=SMPPSim.tar.gz to work well. Simply download it,
cd into the folder and execute ./startsmppsim.(sh|bat). Make sure the script is executable. The coniguration for this simulator is in conf/smppsim.props

Alternatively, the JSMPP project itself has an SMPP simulator as well.

If you want to go the full nine yards, it's pretty easy to find full-blow SMPP servers like Kanell out there.
